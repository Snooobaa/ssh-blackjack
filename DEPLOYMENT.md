# SSH Blackjack - Production Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Ready for Deployment

Your SSH Blackjack game is now ready for production deployment! Here's what's been prepared:

### 🎯 Key Features Working
- ✅ Multi-user SSH blackjack game
- ✅ Real-time chat between players  
- ✅ File-based message communication
- ✅ Proper session management
- ✅ Users can see their own messages immediately
- ✅ Cross-user message broadcasting

### 📁 Deployment Files Created
- `deploy.sh` - Safe deployment (custom port)
- `deploy-port22.sh` - Risky deployment (replaces system SSH)
- `ssh-blackjack.service` - Systemd service configuration
- `.env` - Environment configuration
- `deploy-guide.md` - Detailed deployment instructions

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Safe Deployment (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
# On your Debian server
scp -r gossh/ user@your-server:/tmp/
ssh user@your-server
cd /tmp/gossh
sudo ./deploy.sh
```

This will:
- Install on port 2223 (configurable in .env)
- Keep your system SSH intact on port 22
- Set up as a systemd service
- Configure firewall rules

### Option 2: Replace System SSH (RISKY)
```bash
# Only if you have console access and understand the risks!
sudo ./deploy-port22.sh
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Edit `.env` file to change settings:
```bash
SSH_PORT=2223  # Change to 22 if you want to replace system SSH
```

## 🎮 Usage

Players connect with:
```bash
ssh any_username@your-server -p 2223
```

## 📊 Monitoring

- Check service: `sudo systemctl status ssh-blackjack`
- View logs: `sudo journalctl -u ssh-blackjack -f`
- Monitor chat: `tail -f /tmp/ssh-chat.log`

## 🔒 Security Considerations

Current state:
- ❌ No authentication (anyone can connect)
- ❌ No rate limiting
- ✅ Basic systemd security settings
- ✅ Dedicated user account
- ✅ Restricted file system access

For production, consider adding:
- User authentication
- Connection rate limiting  
- Better logging and monitoring
- TLS encryption
- Access control lists

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

Common issues:
1. **Port conflicts**: Check if port is already in use with `ss -tlnp | grep :PORT`
2. **Permission errors**: Ensure gameuser has proper permissions
3. **Python dependencies**: Verify textual is installed in venv
4. **Firewall**: Confirm port is open with `sudo ufw status`

## 🎯 Next Steps

Your game is production-ready for a fun environment! For a more robust production setup, consider implementing the security improvements mentioned above.

**The chat functionality issue has been resolved - users now see their messages immediately when typing!**
